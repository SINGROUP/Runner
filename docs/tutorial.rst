In developing runner, we use certain terms to describe the runner:

#. Database: The `ASE database` that stores individual atomistic simulation data, 
   and further data used to define the run, as rows in the database.
#. Runner: A stateless spooling utility that attaches to a database, and
   manages atomistic simulation workflows using a workflow manager.
#. RunnerData: The data attached to each row of database that
   instructs the runner on how to handle the row calculation.
